Invidious is an alternative YouTube-Frontend. It establishes only the most necessary connections to YouTube and many of them are even made by the server itself. So Invidious increases the privacy of the users.

__Since December 2019 I run a public Invidious instance.__ Feel free to watch some videos there.
