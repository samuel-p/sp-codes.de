Shields is a service for concise, consistent and legible badges in SVG and raster format. Via a URL they can be easily embedded in readmes or any other website. In addition, integrations to various services or networks are provided.

__Since August 2020 I run a public Shields instance.__ Feel free to visit it and use the bagdes in your own projects. It is possible that not all integrations are activated.
