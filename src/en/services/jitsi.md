Jitsi-Meet is a platform for video conferences. You can start fully encrypted video chats without registration. Additionally, Jitsi-Meet offers the possibility to share the screen with other participants, invite new users with a simple link and send messages in the integrated chat.

__Since July 2020 I run my own Jitsi-Meet instance. You can find it at [jitsi.sp-codes.de](https://jitsi.sp-codes.de/).__

You are welcome to use the instance with other people.
