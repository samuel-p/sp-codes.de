# <i class="i-users"></i> Jitsi Meet

Jitsi-Meet is a platform for video conferences. You can start fully encrypted video chats without registration. Additionally, Jitsi-Meet offers the possibility to share the screen with other participants, invite new users with a simple link and send messages in the integrated chat.

__Since July 2020 I run my own Jitsi-Meet instance. You can find it at [jitsi.sp-codes.de](https://jitsi.sp-codes.de/).__

You are welcome to use the instance with other people.

If you want to have your own Jitsi server for you, your family or your company, I would be happy to support you with my company <a href="https://ossrox.org" target="_blank">Ossrox</a>. Please have a look at our services on our website or send me a message.
