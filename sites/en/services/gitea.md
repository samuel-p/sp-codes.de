# Gitea

Gitea is a simple code hosting platform like GitHub or GitLab. It is open source and under continuous development. __Since the end of 2019 I have my own Gitea instance where I manage my projects.__ For example this website. Feel free to have a look at the source code and leave some feedback.

In addition to Gitea, I also run Drone, a platform that extends Gitea with many continuous integration features, such as automated builds and deploys.

Feel free to visit and sign up if you're interested in developing a project. The registration is open since March 2020.
